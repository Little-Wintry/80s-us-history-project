            <p>Welcome back to the Mini-Spotlight, where we cover some big artists of the 80s in small portions. So far we’ve covered Run D.M.C., Whitney Houston, and U2, and today we take a look at a name I’m sure you’ve all been waiting for - Queen.            </p>
            <p>Queen is, without a doubt, one of the biggest bands of all time, receiving hundreds of awards and accolades over the years. They’re regarded as one of the dominating forces in pop culture for the last half century, and is still semi-active today.            </p>
            <p>	Forming the late 1960s in West London, Queen would have many members swapping in and out in their early days, before the main members of Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon, and Freddie Mercury would solidify into the band. Though they had a slow start, Queen quickly gained momentum among various rock fans. Additionally, while starting in the UK, they would also quickly become a popular staple among US listeners as well. By the 80s, they had fully made a name as an icon in the music industry, and a familiar sound to anyone familiar with rock.            </p>

            <p>Now, going over all the major events of Queen would be an exercise in patience. With dozens of tours and dozens of songs and albums, it would be almost impossible to list them all. Their contributions to the sphere of rock are tremendous, which is reflected best by the amount of artists they’ve inspired. Everyone from rock-based artists Rage Against the Machine, Guns and Roses, Def Leppard, and the Foo Fighters to modern stars like Panic! At the Disco, Katy Perry, BTS, and Lil Nas X have cited Queen as an inspiration for their sound.             </p> 
            <p>Many believe that this longevity is due to the strength of the individual members. While Freddie Mercury was a musical powerhouse, the other members all had their strengths. In fact, Queen is the only band in which every member has composed a number-one hit. In another - if rather odd - display of their fame, they’re also one of the most pirated bands in the world, with over 12,000 sites dedicated to bootlegged music. This has led to their music being incredibly popular even in places where Western music is banned, further contributing to their popularity. One of their most popular songs, Bohemian Rhapsody, became the most streamed song of the 21st century in 2018.             </p> 
            <p>It’s not hard to see why Queen is so popular either. While often classified as classic rock, Queen would frequently branch out and incorporate other genres. This, combined with catchy melodies and Freddy’s singing, helped the band to reach far beyond classic rock and into the mainstream, and helped shape some of the biggest stars of today.             </p>
