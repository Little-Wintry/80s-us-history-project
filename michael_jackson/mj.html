            <p>When you hear “Michael Jackson”, chances are you think of the pop star that left his mark with catchy songs and dance moves. Maybe you think of the iconic Thriller music video, or any number of his chart-topping songs. But the King of Pop has remarkably humble beginnings.</p>
            <p>Born in 1958, in a small town from Indiana, Michael Joseph Jackson was born to Katherine and Joseph Jackson. They were a working-class, African American family, with nine children including the young Michael. The family had aspirations, though - while Joseph played guitar for a local rhythm and blues band to help with the family income, Katherine also had goals to one day be a country singer. Their dreams of stardom would eventually come true, however, in 1964 with the formation of the Jackson Brothers - the precursor to the Jackson 5. And this is where Michael Jackson got his start in music.            </p>

            <p>Through the Jackson 5 - which became a musical monolith in its own right - Michael got into the music industry. While the Jackson 5 primarily produced a mix of pop, rhythm, and funk, their tours would eventually lead to Michael discovering more types of music which would later influence his own career. By 1979, Michael released his solo album Off the Wall, which solidified him as a solo artist and helped to fully launch his career. Michael would end up leaving the Jackson 5 not long after, but still maintained ties with them.            </p>
            <p>Michael would release his next album in 1982, and one you’re probably familiar with: Thriller. A year later, it was the best selling album worldwide, and was in Billboard’s Top 10 for 80 consecutive weeks. Also in 1983, Michael debuted his signature moonwalk dance, and Thriller would go on to win a multitude of awards. This success catapulted Michael to the top of the world of pop culture, helping him earn the title ‘King of Pop’.             </p>

            <p>Michael’s career would last right up until his sudden death in 2009, and though he would occasionally collaborate with new artists, they were few and far between. Part of this may be because of Michael’s eclectic personality - while collaborating with Freddie Mercury of Queen, he was displeased with Freddie’s usage of drugs. Seemingly in response to this, Michael elected to bring a llama into the recording studio.            </p>
            <p>Acts like these would lead to wild tabloid speculation about Michael Jackson, and further investigation would lead to him being something of a troubled figure in the eye of the public. Through his career, Michael’s skin seemed to be gradually growing paler, leading to all sorts of theories - the most popular being that he was bleaching his skin. It was later revealed that Michael was diagnosed with vitiligo, a disease which leads to patches of skin losing their pigmentation over time. This then led to Michael using light-colored makeup and skin bleaching creams in order to even out his skin tone and attempted to turn to surgeries to fix it, not wanting to look like “a spotted cow”.             </p>
            <p>In later biographies and interviews, Michael would also admit to having multiple rhinoplasty surgeries and a cleft chin surgery. He also admitted to losing weight in the early 80’s to achieve “a dancer’s body”, and periods of weight loss would be an issue later in Michael’s life. Michael’s manager, Frank DiLeo, described him as a health fanatic, something that may have contributed to it. The 90’s would also see multiple allegations brought up against Michael involving child abuse, and while he would ultimately be found not guilty, these trials still caused a lot of stress for the artist, leading to addiction.            </p>

            <p>Despite all of these troubles, Michael Jackson was regarded as a philanthropist and humanitarian, so much so that he’s listed in the Guiness Book of World Records for it. He’s said to have donated over 500 million dollars to various charities during his life, but this number is a low estimate, since Michael was also known for giving anonymously. In addition, he performed at a number of charity concerts - some of which he arranged himself - visited sick children and fans globally, and would donate personal items to charity auctions. Even after his death, the Jackson family would continue to donate in honor of Michael.             </p>
            <p>He also used his music as a vehicle for change - songs like Why You Wanna Trip On Me challenges world hunger, AIDS, homelessness, and drugs. Gone Too Soon is another song about AIDS, mourning those who have suffered from it. Jackson also cowrote the song We Are The World, which has been used as a charity theme on multiple occasions. In fact, most of his iconic songs have themes of injustice or protest in them, and have endured through the decades.            </p>

            <p>Michael Jackson’s legacy has - similar to Prince - also endured long past his death in 2009. His memorial service had an estimated 2.5 to 3 billion people watching globally, and had performances by other stars like Stevie Wonder, Mariah Carey, and Lionel Richie. News of his death spread so quickly that it put unprecedented strain on the early internet. Sites like Google, Facebook, and Twitter all crashed from the excess web traffic. Sales were so profitable after his death that in 2014, Michael Jackson became the first artist to have a Top 10 hit in five decades.             </p>
            <p>Right up until his death, Michael was well known for helping to define pop culture. Unlike Prince, who was skilled in a number of instruments, Michael couldn’t read or write musical notation. While he was able to play guitar, keyboard, and drums, they weren’t his strong suit. Instead, he often spoke into a tape recorder, vocally mimicking drums and instruments. Perhaps one of his most memorable qualities were his dances - from the moonwalk to the robot to his ‘anti-gravity lean’ in the Smooth Criminal music video.             </p>

            <p>Those music videos also were some of Michael Jackson’s most influential pieces. It was there that he pioneered new dance moves, broke racial barriers, and defined music videos as whole. Much like Prince, he pushed boundaries of gender and sexuality - many of the videos contained sexually evocative movements to accompany the  The Thriller music video in particular is iconic - it was named the most successful music video by the Guiness Book of World Records, has been parodied hundreds of times, and even inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, as a work has “enduring importance to the American ideal”.             </p>
            <p>This blog post is only the tip of the iceberg for his achievements. He broke dozens of records during his time - at the time of writing, he holds at least 20 titles in the Guiness Book of World Records, only a few of which have been mentioned in this post. World Vitiligo Day is celebrated on the anniversary of his death to raise awareness to the very disease he suffered from. He even had a species of hermit crab named after him! Michael Jackson didn’t just shift pop culture - he’s been impacting us again and again in ways that we never expected, even after his death. With all this and more, including hundreds of awards, it’s not hard to see why Michael Jackson was named the King of Pop.            </p>

            <p>Despite his health struggles - both physical and mental ones - he was able to produce such iconic songs that we’re still listening to them, decades later. And it’s those struggles that so often end up behind the scenes, but they’re important to his legacy. Without those, Michael Jackson is just a pop star. By including those parts of his story, we can remind ourselves and others that you can push through them, and even come out as an icon in the process.             </p>
