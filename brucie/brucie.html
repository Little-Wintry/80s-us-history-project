            <p>Welcome to our final installment of the Mini-Spotlight, where we cover other major artists of the 80s in a much smaller format. We’ve covered some big names from all sorts of genres and backgrounds like Run D.M.C., Whitney Houston, U2, and Queen, and today we cover the man who created an entire genre - Brucei Springsteen.            </p>
            <p>Growing up in a traditional Catholic family in New Jersey, Bruce became interested in music and following in the footsteps of Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra. Encouraged by his mother, he began playing guitar, and became fascinated with the instrument. Bruce was an outcast during his youth, however, described by a teacher as “a loner who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar”. Despite completing high school, he felt so distant from his peers that he didn’t even attend the graduation ceremony.             </p>
            <p>After dropping out of college, and began drifting from band to band. Despite humble beginnings and being almost entirely self taught, Bruce began attracting attention for his folk-rock inspired music and poetic lyrics. This would be a theme for much of Bruce’s career as he essentially created the genre of heartland rock, characterized by the sound of rock mixed with lyrics about social commentary and a simple, blue-collar American life.            </p>

            <p>However, it wasn’t until 1975 where Bruce got his big break. Produced with his band, the E Street Band, Born to Run was Bruce’s most well-received album yet, reaching #3 on Billboard 200. His next album, Born in the USA, is one of his most well known, selling 30 million copies worldwide.            </p> 
            <p>By now, Bruce was solidified as a classic rock artist singing about a blue-collar life, advocating for the rights of workers and becoming active in his political awareness. In one of his most well known concerts, he played in Berlin while the Berlin Wall was up, hoping the sound would carry to the other side of the wall and to the youths of East Germany. Some believe that this performance helped to catalyze opposition to the Eastern German regime, and contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.            </p> 
            <p>Like some of the other artists previously discussed, Bruce is still active today - both musically and politically. Despite being a Catholic, Bruce has supported democratic candidates for President such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and is a noted supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as being a vocal critic of Donald Trump. Despite some of these actions making him unpopular in the primarily conservative realm of rock music, Bruce refuses to let up or change his views.             </p> 
            <p>And truly, those offer an insight into what Bruce is about. Many of his songs reflect this, enforcing themes of what he believes a true American to be - someone working hard and fighting for their freedom, and most importantly, being unified with their country. This further extends to what he believes rock and roll should be, which is a form of art that can be used to connect with others, no matter their background or differences. While some may argue against that, it seems that Bruce has popular opinion on his side - Rolling Stone named him “the embodiment of rock and roll” for a reason.             </p>
