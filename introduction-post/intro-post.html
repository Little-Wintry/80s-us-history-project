        <p>Ah, the 80’s. The time of big hair, bigger shoulder pads, and some of the biggest stars of all time. You ask anyone who lived through the 80’s about the music and pop culture, and they’ll start listing off celebrities left and right, many of whom are still active today. </p>
        <p>But when you start to dig for details, about who was the most popular, the most influential, you get conflicting answers. Was it Madonna, the Queen of Pop? What about Michael Jackson, the King of Pop? How about Prince, who mixed half a dozen genres of music together and created something new? And that’s not even touching on the half dozen others, like Queen, Run D.M.C, U2, and more. </p>
        <p>In an effort to try and break down this list of brightly-shining superstars, I’ve looked into each and every one to see what their influence was. From Michael Jackson’s dance moves to Run D.M.C’s pioneering of the hip-hop genre to Bruce Springsteen’s creation of ‘heartland rock’, every post will look at another influential figure of the 80’s. We’ll also be looking at their influence today - the 80’s may have been almost 40 years ago, but plenty of these artists are still making waves, and their music is still going strong. </p>
        <p>While we’ll have full blog posts dedicated to Prince, Madonna, and Michael Jackson, we’ll also have mini posts dedicated to some other big names from the 80’s. Make sure to stay tuned for our next Superstar Spotlight!</p>
