            <p>This website is the result of our final project for junior year U.S. History class. Our instructions were to pick a decade and study the turning points within that decade, through the lens of things like pop culture, politics, and more. To keep things interesting, we were allowed to do it in the form of either a blog or a podcast, and created our own websites using Google Sites. However, because I have coding knoweldge, I decided to code the website entirely by hand.</p>

            <p>My name is Emma Pegram, an 11th grade student at the time of writing. I've always had an interest in music and loved the aesthetic and pop culture of the 80s. I would like to thank Mrs. Sullivan for encouraging me through the project, Mr. Greider for teaching me my coding skills, and my parents for recommending famous 80s artists to look into.</p>
