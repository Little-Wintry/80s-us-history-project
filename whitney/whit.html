            <p>Welcome back to the Mini-Spotlight, where we cover other big names of the 80’s in a much more bit-sized format. Last time we covered the pioneers of rap and hip-hop, but today we cover a much more conventional pop star from the 80’s - Whitney Houston, one of the best selling artists of all time.            </p>
            <p>Born in 1963, Whitney was surrounded with music from a young age, participating in gospel choir at church. Whitney’s mother, Emily “Cissy” Houston was a Grammy-winning gospel and soul singer, and member of a group that recorded background vocals for artists like Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley, and Aretha Franklin. These connections allowed the young Whitney to get a great deal of experience in singing, and also got into modeling work, becoming one of the first women of color to appear on the cover of a fashion magazine.            </p>
            <p>Whitney’s rise to fame was slow and steady, specializing in soul, gospel, R&B, and funk music. As her career continued, however, she would also become known for blending those elements with a more pop-sounding feel, which further supported her rise to stardom. She would quickly become well known for her vocal talent, and for paving the way for many other women of color to enter the music industry.</p>
            <p>Before long, Whitney had left her mark on the music industry and helped to redefine the genre. Having won both Emmy and Grammy awards, and selling more than 200 million records, it’s no wonder so many artists have cited her as an inspiration. Modern popstars like Adele, Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Celine Dion, and more have all been following in Whitney’s footsteps. Without Whitney helping to pave the way, we likely wouldn’t have some of the biggest stars of our generation.             </p>
