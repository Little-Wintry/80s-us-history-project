            <p>Madonna is nothing like the artists we’ve discussed so far - for one thing, she’s a woman. While this simple difference in gender might seems small, it’s actually a huge part of Madonna’s legacy and impact. She has long been a figure of controversy, most of which comes back to her gender.            </p>
            <p>In fact, Madonna’s been stirring up controversy since her early years. Raised by Italian Catholic parents and going to Catholic schools as a child, she was known for her high grades but rebellious behavior. She would frequently do cartwheels and handstands in the hallways (which often allowed boys to catch glimpses of her underwear), refused to shave her underarms and legs, or wear makeup.             </p>
            <p>These actions, and more, led to the young Madonna getting a reputation as a rebellious teenager. She also had a reputation being bright and talented, however, having taken classical piano and ballet lessons and having some of the highest grades in class.            </p>

            <p>By 1978, Madonna had dropped out of college and moved to New York, with only $35 in her pocket. There, Madonna took dance lessons, performed with various theater troupes. In addition, she form her first band, The Breakfast Club, where was lead vocalist, along with occasionally playing drums and guitar. In 1980, Madonna began promoting herself as a solo artist.            </p>
            <p>By the mid-80’s, Madonna had exploded in popularity. Her music videos and performances were extremely popular with young woman, influencing fashion trends and styles. Her second album, Like a Virgin, became a number-one album globally, including the US, UK, Netherlands, Italy, and more. It was so popular in the US, in fact, that it was the first album by a female to sell over five million copies.             </p>

            <p>The album, however, had critics. The 80’s saw a rise in conservatism among the general population with the presidency of noted Republican Ronald Reagan. During these times, an estimated 85% to 90% of the population was Christian, with many powerful religious groups rising to power during the late 70s and early 80s. In this heavily Christian climate, many of Madonna’s videos, lyrics, and songs were seen as dangerous and sinful. Various religious and conservative organizations complained that Like A Prayer and its accompanying video promoted premarital sex and endangered traditional notions of family.             </p>
            <p>This would be a running theme for many of Madonna’s albums, songs, and videos. The music video for her song Like A Prayer included Catholic imagery such as crosses burning, and the Vatican condemned the video as a whole. Similarly, the video of Justify My Love was deemed unfit for MTV, which featured bondage, same-sex kissing, and brief nudity. A live performance of Like A Prayer in 1990 was similarly criticized by religious groups for having two male dancers suggestively touch Madonna’s body during the performance. One of her most risque tours was in 1993, where dressed as a dominatrix with a whip with topless dancers on stage.            </p>

            <p>Despite all the controversy she stirred, Madonna was still an extremely popular artist. She was dubbed the Queen of Pop, one of the best selling female artists of all time, and has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by The Rolling Stones. Even her provocative actions garnered praise - the 1990 tour that featured the performance of Like A Prayer was regarded as the best tour of that year. Like A Prayer and Like A Virgin topped the charts in multiple different countries.             </p>
            <p>Madonna wasn’t just a singer, either. She’s also been a businesswoman since the 90’s. In 1992, she founded Maverick, an entertainment company that deals with everything from music and records to television and film. While Maverick has been inactive since 2009, Madonna has still managed and produced her own music and media. She has gone on record many times to assert that she wishes to keep creative control of her projects, and producing her own music allows her to do so.</p>

            <p>This independence is a staple of Madonna and her character, and leads directly into her feminism. Aside from being a feminist herself, Madonna has helped to pave the way for other female pop stars, particularly in the 2000s, such as Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and more. Her use of provocative imagery has also played a role - challenging a traditionally Christian system with her lyrics and videos. The Times notes that she “started a revolution among women in music”, and is said to have inspired women to take control of their own sexuality - something that has ruffled a few feathers in the Catholic church.             </p>
            <p>Furthermore, Madonna’s broken down other social barriers through her work. Madonna has a long history of including Black, Latino, and other cultural musical influences in her works and videos, and has been a highly praised figure in the LGBTQ+ community for her emphasis on sexual freedom. Madonna has also been noted as experimenting with and briefly practicing different religions, despite being raised Catholic.             </p>
            <p>These actions, however, are sometimes viewed as appropriation rather than inspiration, and has caused schisms in these communities. Speaking as a white member of the LGBTQ+ community, I personally think Madonna’s songs resonate well with anyone who feels ‘othered’ by social due to their sexuality, but I don’t consider myself educated enough to speak much else.            </p>

            <p>Now unlike Prince and Michael Jackson, Madonna is still alive and active today. This means that it’s not quite as easy to pinpoint Madonna’s impact on pop culture, since she’s still making waves. Another complicating factor is just how complex Madonna’s impact has been - there’s even an entire field of study dedicated to it! ‘Madonna studies’ is a specific niche of American cultural studies, focusing entirely the Queen of Pop and her social impact.             </p>
            <p>While Madonna studies is certainly a very niche part of cultural studies, it’s every existence proves just how much Madonna has changed pop culture. There are dozens of papers dedicated solely to Madonna and her impact, and likely hundreds more that reference the Queen of Pop and her influence. This phonomeon isn’t just limited to Madonna, either - since she’s entered the scholarly space, other pop artists have followed. This use of pop stars in the realm of academia has changed the way we see artists and their influence on the world as a whole. And it was Madonna, the Queen of Pop, who started it all.             </p>

            <p>No matter your opinion on her, Madonna’s impact on pop culture is undeniable, for better or worse. Just like Prince and Michael Jackson, she was a pioneer, paving the way and inspiring dozens of artists after her.             </p>
