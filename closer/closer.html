            <p>Now that we’ve gone over all these artists - and more in our Mini-Spotlight posts - you might be wondering where the big finish is. Sure, we went over all these cool artists and their accomplishments, but we’ve been talking about their impact this whole time. That lends itself well to a final question - who had the biggest impact? Who changed history the most?             </p>
            <p>As much as I’d love to end this blog post with a satisfying answer, a concrete ranking, that’s simply not possible. For one thing, art is subjective. What might be a masterpiece to one person is trash to another. But there’s another, much deeper problem happening here.             </p>
            <p>Think about the big three artists we’ve covered so far. Madonna challenged societal norms with her sexuality and feminism. Michael Jackson completely revolutionized music videos to pave the way for more. Prince flat-out refused to be categorized at all. And neither of them exist in isolation, either - as the most prominent artists of the 80’s, they also influenced each other, knowingly or not.             </p>
            <p>In the end, it’s impossible to compare them side by side. It’s like comparing apples and oranges. Just because Michael Jackson pioneered music videos doesn’t mean Prince’s contributions to fashion and style isn’t important. Just because Prince defied categorization doesn’t mean that Michael Jackson’s similar flexibility is suddenly null and void. This is especially true for any comparisons with Madonna - she was a female popstar in a male-dominated industry. Any comparisons need to take in decades of sexism, gender stereotypes, and conservatism into consideration.             </p>
            <p>While arguments could be made that one artist had a bigger impact than the other, I don’t think that’s something we should be doing. History is a complicated web, with many interlocking parts and overlapping pieces. Even the most black-and-white subjects have shades of gray mixed in. And in the case of these artists - and many, many more I didn’t have time to cover - removing just one piece would change music as we know it today.             </p>
            <p>Much like Prince, history can’t be defined. Much like Michael Jackson, history reinvents itself. Much like Madonna, history pushes the boundaries. These artists haven’t just made history - they are history. They are the building blocks that modern pop culture has made itself on. And once we’re done studying the past, we can move onto the future - to see what new revelations pop culture might have to offer.             </p>
