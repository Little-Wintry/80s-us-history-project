            <p>Welcome back to our third installment of the Mini-Spotlight, where we take a few paragraphs to highlight other iconic artists of the 80s. We already covered Run D.M.C. and Whitney Houston, and now we look at U2, an Irish rock band who helped to redefine rock and blur the boundaries.            </p>
            <p>Inspired by early punk rock bands like Sex Pistols and The Stranglers, a 14-year-old Larry Mullen Jr. helped to form the band that would one day become U2 - then known as Feedback. The band included Paul “Bono” Hewson on the vocals, David “The Edge” and Dik Evans on guitar, Adam Clayton on bass, and Ivan McCormick. While McCormick would be dropped from the group a few weeks later, the boys continued to hold practices in the music room at school, determined to rise to fame despite an overall lack of musical knowledge.            </p>
            <p>Shortly after in 1977, Dik Evans graduated to college and left the group. He went on to join another band, the Virgin Prunes, which would become a common opener for many of Feedback’s acts. That same year, they changed the bands name from Feedback to The Hype, and a year later they changed it to U2 - chosen for it’s ambiguity and many interpretations.            </p>
            <p>With the help of Bill Graham - a journalist for Irish magazine Hot Press - U2 was able to find Paul McGuinness as a manager. With Paul’s help, they were able to find gigs across Ireland, slowly building a dedicated fanbase, before being discovered by Island Records. Soon after, they signed a four year, four album contract, and U2 was finally starting their rise to stardom.            </p>

            <p>Despite their humble origins, U2 proceeded to dominate the realm of alternative rock, particularly in the 80s. They were well known for high-energy concerts and meaningful lyrics, with many songs possessing political and social themes and commentary. Many concerts and tours were launched by the band to raise money for all manner of causes, often collaborating with other artists to do so.             </p>
            <p>Similarly to Madonna, U2 is still active today, with the album Songs of Surrender being released in March of 2023. And truth be told, not much has changed for them - they’re still producing music with a mix of punk and rock, and they’re still doing good for their community.             </p>
