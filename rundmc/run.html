            <p>Welcome to the speed round of the blog posts, which covers some other big names of the 80s in a much shorter fashion. First up for our Mini-Spotlight, the hip-hop group Run D.M.C.             </p>
            <p>Formed in 1983 in Queens, New York City, Run D.M.C. consisted of Joseph “Run” Simmons, Darryl “D.M.C” McDaniels, and Jason “Jam Master” Mizell. Each started out their careers as DJs and small-time hip-hop artists. Initially, the Joseph and Darryl formed the band and released a single, which went almost entirely unnoticed. Refusing to quit, however, the duo recruited Joseph to be their official DJ, and signed off with Profile Records. They produced mostly a combination of rap and hip-hop, with rock influences added in.            </p>
            <p>While their debut single It’s Like That/Sucker MCs launched them into the mainstream, they kept the ball rolling with songs such as Hard Times and Rock Box, proving themselves to be more than a one-hit wonder. In 1986, they would collaborate with rock group Aerosmith for the hit single Walk This Way, and one of their most famous songs, It’s Tricky, had it’s music video released that year as well.             </p>
            <p>The group would unfortunately disband in 2002 when Jason Mizell was shot as his recording studio in Queens, in a murder that would remain unsolved until 2020. Despite having not released any official songs since, Joseph Simmons and Darryl McDaniels would continue to make occasional appearances in the public eye, and their songs have been covered and remixed by many other hip-hop and rap artists.            </p>
            <p>More than anything, Run D.M.C. helped to pioneer the look, sound, and overall feel of modern hip-hop. While old school rappers tended towards flashy outfits and glamorous performances, Run D.M.C. learned towards a more ‘street’ style, employing baggy clothes, leather jackets, and Adidas shoes (which weren’t nearly as popular during the time). Practically overnight, Run D.M.C. transformed rap and hip-hop from a flashy but underground movement to the street-styled genre we know it as today.</p>

            <p>There’s no mystery to the longevity of this trend, either, since the members of Run D.M.C. helped to mentor and produce new artists. They directly mentored other well-known hip-hop artists like 50 Cent, they also inspired a number of other artists and rappers, helping bringing the rise to groups like Rage Against the Machine and Linkin Park. It’s undeniable that without Run D.M.C paving the way for the rap and hip-hop genres, we’d miss out on some big names: everyone from Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Eminem to newer rappers like Travis Scott or Post Malone owe their career to the pioneers of the genre.             </p>
